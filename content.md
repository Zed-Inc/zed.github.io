## Interest in IT

 What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
 Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

+ I am interested in IT because of the wide variety of fields it can lead to from finance to defence
+ My interest in it started at a young age, i would say around teh time i got a 3rd gen ipod and saw
  that someone had made this wonderful piece of tech that can store hundereds of songs
+ A paticular event that sparked my interest in IT again was when i was experimenting with digital art
  and i was looking for a free colour wheel plugin for photoshop, after not being able to find one
  i decided to make my own and that is how i discovered programming which lead to this degree
+ I have very little professional IT experience, otherwise i only have the experience i have gained from doing previous units
+ I chose to come to rmit because it focuses on more stem related fields and it has a reputation of
  it's alumni doing some pretty amazing things in those fields
+ I expect to learn relevant IT skills that can help me get a job after/while doing this degree
  not only that but to also meet some other students whom i can work alongside with and become friends with

## Personal profile

Myers-Briggs test result = “The Mediator” (INFP-T)
I think these test results are quite accurate for how i work and act on a daily basis
I think the results wont affect my behaviour on a team to much maybe the first week while i learn more
about my teammates. After that inital stage adn once a plan has been developed then i will probably focus 
my effort on my task while helping my team mates with any problems that might arise in their section
while forming a team i should probably team up with someone of the opposite type, someone who is a planner/logical thinker

[online learning test](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=4&V=11&T=5)

+ Auditory: 20%
+ Visual: 55%
+ Tactile: 25%

I think these results are exactly how i learn and in an online environment i would say it is a benifit. 
I dont think these results will be a hinderence while working in a team, the only thing that it might affect is if i ask someone to show me how to do something rather then explaining it to me. I dont think there is anything to take into account when forming a team with these results, i feel as though they are not as big of an affector as what the personality test would be


[creativity test](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm)
i scored a 55 on this test putting me in the "Work in progress" creativity catergory
I think that is how my creativity works when working in a team, I create an answer to a problem
and then present it to the team and get feedback before going back to the drawing board for the next creative iteration.
My behaviour will probably change to be more vocal when trying to solve a problem, i dont think this change in behaviour will change anything while forming a team
