  <!-- IT questions -->
  <div class="block">
    <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? <br>
      Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> I am interested in IT because of the wide variety of fields it can lead to from finance to defence </li>
        
        <li> My interest in it started at a young age, i would say around teh time i got a 3rd gen ipod and saw <br>
        that someone had made this wonderful piece of tech that can store hundereds of songs </li>

        <li> A paticular event that sparked my interest in IT again was when i was experimenting with digital art <br>
          and i was looking for a free colour wheel plugin for photoshop, after not being able to find one <br>
          i decided to make my own and that is how i discovered programming which lead to this degree </li>

        <li> I have very little professional IT experience, otherwise i only have the experience i have gained from doing previous units</li>

        <li> I chose to come to rmit because it focuses on more stem related fields and it has a reputation of <br>
          it's alumni doing some pretty amazing things in those fields</li>

        <li> I expect to learn relevant IT skills that can help me get a job after/while doing this degree<br>
          not only that but to also meet some other students whom i can work alongside with and become friends with</li>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <img id="pic" src="assets/about.png"  alt="Job description"  draggable="false">
    <a href="https://au.indeed.com/jobs?q=ios%20developer&l=Australia&vjk=58f3972bf530042e" id="link">Indeed link</a>
    <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/xero/71efa2a1-9a9a-4d45-9ff0-df2093c14923?lever-source=Indeed" id="link">company job link</a>
    
    <p>
      The job position is a senior IOS developer with a wide variety of skills of the whole pitch/idea to working product pipeline <br>
      The position is appealing to me because I get to work on a product that helps the smaller business rather then the large corporations <br>
      The company Xero works in a different domain finance and accounting which is another field i am interested in <br>
      Skills required for this position are extensive knowledge with Swift, Obj-C, Xcode and git<br>
      experience with the whole development cycle unit testing and qa testing are important.<br>
      Interaction with multiple departments across the organisation while in the development stage<br>
      <br>
      The skills i have currently are basic swift/ios development skills and basic unit testing on code<br>
      Knowledge on the pitch/idea to product pipeline is minimal<br>
      <br>
      My plan to obtain the skills required is to build more apps and finished products with each new app incorporating something<br>
      from the development pipeline. Greater knowledge with Swift/Obj-C and git can only be obtained through continued use <br>

  <!-- Personal Profile -->

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3>
    <p>
      Myers-Briggs test result = "The Mediator" (INFP-T) <br>
      I think these test results are quite accurate for how i work and act on a daily basis<br>
      I think the results wont affect my behaviour on a team to much maybe the first week while i learn more<br>
      about my teammates. After that inital stage and once a plan has been developed then i will probably focus <br>
      my effort on my task while helping my team mates with any problems that might arise in their section<br>
      while forming a team i should probably team up with someone of the opposite type, someone who is a planner/logical thinker<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Online Learning test</h3>
    <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=4&V=11&T=5" id ="link" target="_blank">learning test</a>
    <ul>
      <li> Auditory: 20%</li>
      <li> Visual: 55%</li>
      <li> Tactile: 25% </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I think these results are exactly how i learn and in an online environment i would say it is a benefit. <br>
      I don't think these results will be a hindrance while working in a team, <br>
      the only thing that it might affect is if i ask someone to show me how to do something rather then explaining it to me. <br>
      I don't think there is anything to take into account when forming a team with these results, <br>
      I feel as though they are not as big of an affector as what the personality test would be <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Creativity test</h3>
    <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm" id="link" target="_blank">creativity test</a>
    <p>
      i scored a 55 on this test putting me in the "Work in progress" creativity catergory<br>
      I think that is how my creativity works when working in a team, I create an answer to a problem<br>
      and then present it to the team and get feedback before going back to the drawing board for the next creative iteration.<br>
      My behaviour will probably change to be more vocal when trying to solve a problem, i don't think this change in behaviour will change anything while forming a team <br>

  <!-- Project report -->
  <div class="block">
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>Project idea</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Many times people have gone into their local book shop and bought a book basing the story off of the cover art,
      description or review located on the backside of the book. But these descriptions and reviews are not always right 
      sometimes these are made to make the book sound better than reality. 
      This app aims to help in those decisions by using your phone’s camera to scan a book cover where it will then pull 
      up a selection of reviews from people who have really read the book so you can make an informed decision.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      Motivation for this project came about after having spent hundreds of dollars on books that <br>
      have glowing reviews and descriptions that draw you in located on the back only to read the book <br>
      and find a mess of writing and storylines inside. Unable to find anything that was suitable <br>
      or did what I want wanted it to with a simple UI was also a large motivating factor in deciding <br>
      to purse this application. This application aims to solve these problems by providing an easy to use <br>
      and intuitive interface for helping shoppers find books that they Willa actually enjoy reading.<br>

    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <!-- main book scanning feature -->
    <p>
      The main feature of the app is its ability to scan a book and extract the title and author from the photo taken.
      Once the user scans a book cover the app will then run the image through a coreML text extraction model integrated 
      within the app, this machine learning model has been trained to extract the title and author from hundreds of reference photos. 
      If the model can't extract the title and author(this can be for a variety of reasons
      such as poor lighting, title and author text placement are in odd spots, etc..) then the user will be prompted to enter those details manually.
      The goodreads api is used to fetch the book reviews where they are then displayed in a cascading list down the screen which you can then sort by 
      rating/star as you would on the website. The goodreads api was chosen because of the 1,000,000+ books and reviews already on the site and 
      because of its high use and trustworthiness among the literature community.
    </p>
    <!-- review feature -->
    <p>
      A smaller but still very useful feature of the app is it's ability to leave a review,
      so once you have finished reading the book and you want to tell everyone about how good it is you have two options,
      option number one is to go onto goodreads and search up the book you have and leave a review that way, that takes to long.
      Option number two is to scan the book and flip over to the review section, here you can write out your review to your hearts content 
      before pressing the 'upload' button, the scanning way is easier and for people with a lot of books definitely makes the review process a lot faster.
    </p>

    <!-- dvd scanning feature-->
    <p>
      A similar feature to the book scanning aspect of the app is its ability to also scan dvd's, 
      in this way we can expand upon the already existing text extraction machine learning model used in the app.
      To search for movies a simple toggle switch or button will be pressed, on the backend side all this button does is switch out the api used,
      on the frontend there is no noticeable change. IMDB and rotten tomatoes api’s will be used for fetching reviews because of their high catalogue
      of movies and reviews
    </p>
    <!--  Touching on the UI of the app-->
    <p>
      Touching briefly on the user interface of the app, it is designed to be as intuitive, fast and simple to use, 
      the main home screen just features a background which is your camera's view and a simple scan button which you press to take a photo of the book 
      and a book/dvd button toggle. After pressing the scan button the view shifts to a cascading card view of reviews which can be sorted by their stars
    </p>
    <!-- Extracting backend into seperate service -->
    <p>
      Eventually in the future the whole backed will be extracted and turned into a seperate rest service for use across multiple different domains, 
      so using the api you can integrate it into a hardware store app and scan the tags to bring up item information from the store website. 
      These sorts of use cases can be extremely useful in hospitals for scanning containers and products. 
      What started out as a simple book scanning app has now grown into a backend service with a large variety of use cases
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
    <p>
      The technologies used in this app include machine learning, networking and simple app development.
      The initial version of this app will be designed for the apple iPhone using Swift as the core language of choice,
      for the user interface design and programming SwiftUI will be used because of its simplicity and hot reload capabilities in the Xcode editor. 
      A simple machine learning model will be made with CoreML apples machine learning framework. Networking will be done by using either
      the inbuilt networking system in swifts Foundation library or using Alamofire. All these technologies have pages of documentation and examples for developers.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Skills required</h3>
    <p>
      The skills needed to develop this app are basic programming knowledge with Swift and some knowledge about networking and making api calls.
      Apple provides a dashboard like interface for CoreML so you don't have to do any programming to setup your model. 
      On the networking side of things knowledge on how to setup an api call, decoding the response into an appropriate data structure and handling errors is a must.
      SwiftUI is an intuitive user interface framework that once you get over that initial hurdle is simple to use and makes it easy to design complex screens and interfaces.

    </p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      The final outcome of this project is to create a useful application to test my current skills and gain new ones, 
      it should also be something that I can publish on the app store and show to potential employers as proof that I can create a clean, slick application that meets the needs of the users and the business.
       The original problem will have been solved in a clean, user friendly way and will both augment and improve upon the existing applications and services currently available on the market.
        This application should impact shoppers by helping them make informed decisions about the products that they are planning on buying, 
        it should also dissuade publishers and authors from putting misleading reviews on their covers
